A Python-based simulation of solar PV, battery storage and grid interaction for residential or microgrid applications.
The model operates on time-series irradiance and load data, prioritizing battery charging before any grid export.
Surplus PV power is exported only when the battery is fully charged thus maximizing self-consumption.
